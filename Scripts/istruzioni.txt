The goal of the project is to write a synthetic (15 pages) scientific article.
We have to choose a topic which is not the same as the datasets.
We have to first make some questions (suppose to be a policy maker, or a scientist, someone that is interested in understanding the topic or the problem), the more practical part is not the main point.
Possible conclusion: data cannot answer our questions (are not enough or not enough powerful).
We are not measured on the complexity of the algorithm, but on the question and the steps we make (which must be motivated and reasonable).
We have to develop a complex reasoning.
Do not use standard sentences!!!
Motivate why we choose a specific model instead of another model.
